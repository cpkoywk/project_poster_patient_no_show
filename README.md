# Project_poster_patient_no_show_problem
IST719 - Information Visualization - Spring 2017 @ Syracuse University w/ Prof. Hemsley

## Data questions:
Missing medical appointment has become a prevalent problems for the healthcare systems in many countries including the US, as missed appointments cost the U.S. healthcare system more than [$150 billion a year](http://www.postgazette.com/business/businessnews/2013/02/24/No-shows-cost-health-care-systembillions/stories/201302240381). As the politicians and the people of this country are always complaining about too much money spent on the healthcare, I want to explore what factors might contribute to the no-show problem to the medical appointments.

## My audiences:
My audience could be the healthcare providers who want to decrease the patient no-show rate, and the government agency who wants to increase the efficiency of the spending on healthcare system.

## Dataset description:
The dataset I am working on has 300,000 medical appointments data as rows and their 15
characteristics as columns. Those characteristics include the patient’s gender, age, day of the
week of the appointment, what kind of their appointment is, are they receiving government’s
financial help on medical bills, whether the healthcare provides send them SMS reminder, etc.,
and most importantly, whether they show up to the appointment or not.
